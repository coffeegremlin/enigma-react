# React built Enigma Machine

### This one's for you Alan Turing

This is an exercise for myself to create an enigma machine, and research cryptography a bit. The first phase is studying how to get the rotors to work, and match a user input to the afor mentioned rotor. Currently I'll only be creating a single plugboard configuration until I can successfully complete a loop that repeats consistently. Once that is working future plugboard selections or possibly user definded plugboards may be possible.
